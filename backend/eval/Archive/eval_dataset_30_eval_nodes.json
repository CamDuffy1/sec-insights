These impairment charges resulted in the recording of impairment charges for the related operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and leasehold improvements, as well as abandonment charges for the related data center assets.

These measures included facility consolidation, layoffs, and a reevaluation of the data center investment strategy.\n\nAs part of the facility consolidation strategy, the company made the decision to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases. This was done to align the company's real property lease arrangements with its anticipated operating needs. As a result, the company recorded impairment charges for the related operating lease right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements.\n\nIn November 2022, the company announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments. This decision was made to pursue greater cost efficiency and realign the company's workforce with its strategic priorities. The company recorded severance and other personnel-related expenses for the impacted employees.\n\nIn December 2022, the company reevaluated its data center investment strategy to improve efficiency and advance its efforts around artificial intelligence. As a result, the company decided to pivot several data center building projects to a next-generation design and cancel multiple existing data center projects. This strategy led to abandonment charges for the related data center assets.\n\nThese restructuring measures had an impact on the company's operations and employees. The facility consolidation and data center investment strategy changes aimed to improve cost efficiency and align the company's resources with its strategic priorities. However, they also resulted in impairment and abandonment charges, indicating a financial impact on the company.\n\nThe layoffs of approximately 11,000 employees had a direct impact on the affected individuals and their livelihoods. It is important to note that the specific details of the impact on employees, such as severance packages and support provided, are not mentioned in the given context information.\n\nOverall, the restructuring measures undertaken by the company during the year ended December 31, 2022, were aimed at improving cost efficiency, realigning the business, and advancing strategic priorities.

The number of users affects the number of ads that can be shown and the value of those ads to marketers. Additionally, user engagement, measured by metrics such as DAUs (Daily Active Users) and MAUs (Monthly Active Users), also impacts revenue and financial results.\n\nDAUs represent registered and logged-in Facebook users who visited Facebook through the website, mobile devices, or used the Messenger application on a given day. DAUs are seen as a measure of user engagement on Facebook. MAUs, on the other hand, represent registered and logged-in Facebook users who visited Facebook through the website, mobile devices, or used the Messenger application in the last 30 days. MAUs are a measure of the size of Facebook's global active user community.\n\nThe relationship between user metrics (DAUs and MAUs) and revenue and financial results is that an increase in the number of DAUs and MAUs can lead to higher revenue. More users mean more ads can be shown, increasing ad revenue. Additionally, higher user engagement, as indicated by a higher DAU/MAU ratio, can also lead to increased revenue as ads become more valuable to marketers.\n\nIt is important to note that the numbers for key Facebook metrics, such as DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or other products unless they qualify as DAUs or MAUs based on their activities on Facebook.",
