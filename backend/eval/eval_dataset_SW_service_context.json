Reduced ability to effectively target ads: Some of the changes implemented by the company may reduce their ability to target ads effectively. This can result in less relevant ads being shown to users, leading to lower engagement and potentially lower demand for ads.\n\n2. Decreased user engagement: If user engagement decreases, including the time spent on the company's products, it can adversely affect the advertising revenue. Advertisers may be less interested in placing ads on platforms with lower user engagement.\n\n3. Inability to increase user access and engagement: If the company is unable to continue increasing user access to and engagement with their products, it can impact the demand for ads. Advertisers may prefer platforms with a larger user base and higher engagement levels.\n\n4. Changes in ad format and prominence: Product changes or inventory management decisions that alter the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on the company's products can also affect advertising revenue. Advertisers may prefer platforms that offer more favorable ad placements.\n\n5. Decreased marketer demand or pricing: The company's advertising revenue can be adversely affected if they are unable to maintain or increase marketer demand or pricing for their ads.

        "f530462a-5dc5-416f-8b39-1c462071cde3": "Meta supports the health and well-being of its employees through various programs and benefits. Some examples include autism care, cancer care, transgender services, holistic well-being, and mental health programs. These programs are designed and funded to meet the specific needs of employees and their dependents. Additionally, Meta offers flexible benefits that help boost employee physical and mental health, create financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community.",
        "86e10eb1-1269-434e-9c84-3042eaecfd60": "Meta promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace in several ways. They offer full-time fully remote positions, even in locations where they do not have offices, which has deepened the diversity of their candidate pool. According to their Diversity Report published in July 2022, providing remote optionality increased the diversity of their workforce. U.S candidates who accepted remote job offers were substantially more likely to be Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, veterans, and/or people with disabilities. Globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were more likely to be women. This shows that offering remote job options has had a positive impact on the diversity of Meta's workforce.",
        "a1735960-524b-48dd-a332-314aacadd7e2": "Basic EPS and diluted EPS are two measures used to calculate a company's earnings per share. Basic EPS represents the earnings per share based on the company's net income and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS, on the other hand, takes into account the potential dilution of earnings per share from the conversion of certain securities, such as stock options or convertible bonds.\n\nTo calculate basic EPS, the net income is divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. In the example provided in the document, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the net income for Class A common stock is $19,729 million, and the weighted-average number of shares used in the computation is 2,285 million. Therefore, the basic EPS for Class A common stock is $8.63 ($19,729 million divided by 2,285 million shares).\n\nDiluted EPS takes into account the potential dilution of earnings per share from the conversion of certain securities. In the example provided, the net income for diluted EPS is adjusted by the effect of converting Class B common stock to Class A common stock. This adjustment reallocates a portion of the net income to Class A common stock. Additionally, the diluted EPS calculation includes the weighted-average effect of dilutive restricted stock units (RSUs).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the net income for diluted EPS is $23,200 million, which includes the reallocation of net income from the conversion of Class B to Class A common stock. The weighted-average number of shares used in the computation of diluted EPS is 2,702 million, which includes the conversion of Class B to Class A common stock and the effect of dilutive RSUs. Therefore, the diluted EPS for Class A common stock is $8.59 ($23,200 million divided by 2,702 million shares).\n\nIn summary, basic EPS represents the earnings per share based on the net income and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, while diluted EPS takes into account the potential dilution of earnings per share from the conversion of certain securities and includes the effect of dilutive securities in the calculation.",
        "8437a8d6-4aec-47e9-a95a-769fe74e8037": "Approximately 95 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of restricted stock units (RSUs) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the year ended December 31, 2022 because including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. This means that including these shares would not have a positive impact on the diluted EPS calculation. The exclusion of these shares from the calculation helps to provide a more accurate representation of the potential dilution of earnings per share."
