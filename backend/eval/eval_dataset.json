Principal reductions of debt reduce the company's liabilities and improve its financial health. Cash payments for business acquisitions represent investments in expanding the company's operations and can affect its future growth potential. Therefore, excluding these payments from the analysis of free cash flows would provide an incomplete picture of the company's financial performance and its ability to generate cash.",
