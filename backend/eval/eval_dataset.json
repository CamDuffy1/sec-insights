When the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised remaining useful life. In this specific case, the extension of the estimated average useful lives of servers and network assets resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense of $860 million and an increase in net income of $693 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This means that the changes in estimated useful lives directly impact the depreciation expense recorded on the income statement and ultimately affect the net income reported.",

Marketers pay for these ad products based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions taken by users. \n\nRevenue from impression-based ads is recognized in the contracted period when the impressions are delivered, meaning when the ad is displayed to a user. On the other hand, revenue from action-based ads is recognized in the period when a user takes the action that the marketer contracted for. \n\nThe number of ads shown can vary based on the type of product (e.g., video, Reels, feed, Stories) and may change over time as part of the company's product and monetization strategies. The average price per ad is calculated as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective (impression or action). \n\nFor advertising revenue arrangements where Facebook is not the principal, revenue is recognized on a net basis.

DAUs are considered a measure of user engagement on Facebook because they represent the number of users who actively interact with the platform on a daily basis. Higher DAUs indicate that users are consistently using the platform, engaging with content, and potentially seeing and interacting with ads, which can impact revenue and financial results.\n\nDAUs differ from Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in that DAUs measure the number of users who engage with the platform on a daily basis, while MAUs measure the number of users who engage with the platform at least once in a 30-day period. MAUs provide a broader view of the overall user base and community size on Facebook, while DAUs offer insights into the daily activity and engagement levels of users.

A higher ARPU indicates that Facebook is generating more revenue from each user, which can be a positive indicator of the platform's advertising and monetization strategies. It also helps in evaluating the company's revenue growth potential and overall financial health. Additionally, ARPU can be used to compare Facebook's performance with competitors and track changes in user engagement and monetization over time.",

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, and other catastrophic events could result in service disruptions or outages, impacting user experience and financial results.

Building new experiences that improve people's lives and set the stage for future improvements.\n3. Supporting businesses that rely on their services to grow and create jobs.\n4. Communicating transparently about their actions and the role their services play in the world.\n\nThese priorities drove expense growth in 2023, as investments in data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount continued. This expense growth adversely affected the company's operating margin and profitability. The majority of investments were directed towards developing their family of apps, with 82% of total costs and expenses recognized in FoA (Family of Apps) and 18% in RL (Reality Labs). FoA investments included expenses related to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure for app and advertising service development. RL investments included expenses related to headcount and technology development for metaverse efforts. Many RL investments were focused on long-term research and development for metaverse products that may only be fully realized in the next decade.",

For example, in 2022, tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation increased the provision for income taxes by $471 million and the effective tax rate by two percentage points. If the stock price continues to vary in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation, the effective tax rate may be inversely impacted.

The diluted EPS is then calculated by dividing the adjusted net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\n\nIn the provided data, the basic EPS and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they have the same liquidation and dividend rights. The calculations for both basic and diluted EPS are shown for Class A and Class B common stock for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The numerator for both basic and diluted EPS is the net income, while the denominator includes the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and any adjustments for dilutive securities.",

This means that including these shares would have increased the diluted EPS, making it less accurate as it would not reflect the potential dilution effect of these RSUs. If these shares were included, the diluted EPS calculation would have been impacted by an increase in the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding, potentially leading to a lower diluted EPS figure."
