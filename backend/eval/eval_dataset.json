Similarly, in Russia, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted and then prohibited by the government, which has already adversely affected and is likely to continue affecting revenue and business in the region.\n\nThese restrictions pose potential risks for Facebook's advertising revenue in China and Turkey. For example, in China, the government could take action that reduces or eliminates China-based advertising revenue, potentially in response to trade disputes with the United States, content issues in Hong Kong, or other reasons. Similarly, in Turkey, if Facebook is found to be out of compliance with legal requirements for social media companies, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to Facebook's products.",

Factors that contribute to higher revenue and ARPU in regions like United States & Canada and Europe include the size and maturity of the online and mobile advertising markets in those regions. Additionally, the average revenue per person (ARPP) in these regions is relatively higher, leading to higher revenue and ARPU compared to regions with lower ARPP.",
